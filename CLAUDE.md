## Important Notes

- This is a structured learning project for learning Rust through game engine development

- Read actual implementation files before writing lesson content
- Two modes: Lesson Mode (generate guides) vs Direct Implementation Mode (implement features)
- The student writes all code themselves in Lesson Mode
