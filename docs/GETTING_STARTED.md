# Getting Started with RustGL

Welcome! This guide will help you begin your Rust learning journey through game engine development.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Introduction**
   - Start with [README.md](./README.md) to understand the project
   - Review [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) to see the complete learning path

2. **Begin Phase 1**
   - Go to [Phase 1, Step 1: Hello Rust](./phase-01-foundation/step-01-hello-rust.md)
   - Work through each step sequentially
   - Don't skip ahead - each step builds on the previous ones!

3. **Work at Your Own Pace**
   - Take your time to understand each concept
   - Complete the challenges in each step
   - Ask for code reviews when you finish a step

## Learning Philosophy

This is a **learn-by-doing** project. Here's how it works:

### For Each Step:

1. **Read** the step documentation thoroughly
2. **Understand** what you need to implement
3. **Write** the code yourself (no copy-paste from examples!)
4. **Test** your implementation
5. **Review** - Ask for feedback on your code
6. **Iterate** - Improve based on feedback
7. **Move on** once you're confident

### Important Guidelines:

- **Write all code yourself** - This is crucial for learning Rust
- **Ask questions** - If something is unclear, ask!
- **Experiment** - Try the challenges and variations
- **Debug** - When things break, figure out why
- **Review** - Always request a code review before moving forward

## What You'll Build

By the end of this journey, you'll have created a complete 3D game engine with:

**Graphics Features:**
- Modern OpenGL rendering pipeline
- Mesh rendering (spheres, cubes, terrain)
- Texture mapping
- Phong lighting
- Skybox environments
- Water with reflections and refractions
- Volumetric clouds
- Transparency and blending

**Procedural Generation:**
- Perlin noise implementation
- Fractal terrain generation
- Dynamic height map generation

**Physics & Simulation:**
- Gravity and velocity
- Collision detection
- Particle systems
- Chain reactions

**Engine Features:**
- FPS camera system
- Input handling
- Scene graph management
- Debug visualization
- In-engine UI
- Performance monitoring

## Time Commitment

**Estimated Timeline:**
- **Phase 1:** 1 week (Rust basics and windowing)
- **Phase 2:** 2 weeks (Core rendering)
- **Phase 3:** 1-2 weeks (Textures and lighting)
- **Phase 4:** 2 weeks (Advanced effects)
- **Phase 5:** 1-2 weeks (Procedural generation)
- **Phase 6:** 2 weeks (Optimization and physics)
- **Phase 7:** 1-2 weeks (Volumetric rendering)
- **Phase 8:** 1-2 weeks (Polish)

**Total: 12-16 weeks** at a comfortable pace (5-10 hours per week)

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- A computer (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
- Willingness to learn
- Basic programming knowledge (any language)

**Not Required:**
- Prior Rust experience
- Graphics programming experience
- Game development experience

You'll learn everything you need along the way!

## Development Environment

**You'll need:**
1. **Rust** - Installed via rustup
2. **GLFW** - System library for windowing
3. **A text editor** - VS Code, Vim, Emacs, etc.
4. **Terminal** - For running cargo commands

**Recommended VS Code extensions:**
- rust-analyzer (Rust language support)
- Better TOML (for Cargo.toml)
- Error Lens (shows errors inline)

## Project Structure

Your final project will look like this:

## Getting Help

**If you get stuck:**

1. **Read the step again** - Often the answer is in the documentation
2. **Check the error message** - Rust has excellent error messages
3. **Review previous steps** - The concept might have been covered earlier
4. **Ask for help** - Request guidance or a code review
5. **Take a break** - Sometimes stepping away helps

**Common resources:**
- The Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
- Learn OpenGL: https://learnopengl.com/
- docs.rs: Documentation for all Rust crates

## Tips for Success

1. **Be patient with Rust's borrow checker**
   - It's strict but prevents entire categories of bugs
   - The compiler messages are helpful - read them carefully
   - Fighting the borrow checker teaches you safe memory management

2. **Understand before moving on**
   - Don't rush to the next step
   - Make sure you grasp the current concept
   - Complete at least some challenges

3. **Experiment freely**
   - Try breaking things to see what happens
   - Modify values and observe the results
   - The compiler will keep you safe

4. **Keep your code clean**
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add comments to explain complex parts
   - Refactor as you learn better patterns

5. **Celebrate progress**
   - Each step is an achievement!
   - Take screenshots of your renders
   - You're building something real
